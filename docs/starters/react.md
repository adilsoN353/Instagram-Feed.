# Hello World with React boilerplate

This template is similar to create-react-app but it's meant for 4Geeks Academy students.

##### Download the boilerplate using git

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```

##### and install the npm package:
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Start coding!

For Windows, Mac, Linux or Gitpod, start the webpack server with live reload:
- `$ npm run start`

You can update the `styles/index.css` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.

## Publish your website!

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting.

It takes just 2 minutes to deploy, [click here to start the process](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello/blob/master/docs/DEPLOY.md).
